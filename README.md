===================

all issues regarding the ts be it perms, or channels etc to be posted here.

Please use the priority labelling system.

P1: this is a high priority issue, and should be fixed right now, this will mean it is frequently occuring, and is
a nuisance for whomever encounters the issue.

P2: this is a medum priority issue, it's more important than a spelling error for example, these may include permission, 
or channel permission errors.

P3: this is a low priority issue, it can be left, but shouldn't be left anyway, because it's still an issue regardless
These issues are not very important, they are minor, and could be for example a channel name having an error in spelling.

General procedure, when you create a new issue, you should explain it in the most detailed way possible, you should
also assign insanity414all to resolve the issue, by assigning me, you will ensure that i actually know the issue exists! :P

This is a basic readme, this will be expanded upon in the future, and remember, we're working towards a 
perfect release, no matter how small the issue may seem, report it here.
